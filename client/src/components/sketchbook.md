Sketchbook for the scroll feature

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp

For this feature, I want to send all the data collected about the books to a scrollable list.

This list will have segments that feature relevant information from each book.

Each segment will have some kind of button or checkbox that lets the app know it's the book you want to submit to the database.

When the submit form button is pressed, the username and the chosen book data will be sent to the database, but not the search term.
